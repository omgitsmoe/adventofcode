# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains solutions to a large portion of
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems,
implemented in a variety of programming languages. Each day’s challenge
is typically solved in one language, but occasionally there are multiple
solutions per day to compare approaches or benchmark performance.

## Structure

- Solutions are organized primarily by year, and within each year by day.
- Each year’s directory contains the corresponding solutions, with code
  files named to indicate the day they solve.
- Languages include Python, C++, Rust, Haskell, Zig, HTML, and more.

## Purpose

- Explore Advent of Code challenges using a variety of programming
  languages, often ones I'm less familiar with.
- Experiment with different approaches and see how problem-solving
  strategies and performance characteristics differ across languages.
- Occasionally serve as a reference if a solution is unclear or you get
  stuck.

## Usage

1. Browse the repository by year and day to find a solution.
2. Each solution is self-contained and can usually be run directly in
   its respective language environment.
3. Compare solutions in different languages for the same problem to
   understand differences in implementation strategies and performance.
