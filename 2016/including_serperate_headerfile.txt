when i
#include "lib/MD5.h"

then i have to either compile my main file together with MD5.cpp to make it work
cl /EHsc -Z7 d5.cpp lib\MD5.cpp

or i compile MD5.cpp seperately (using -c option which only compiles without linking)
cl -c /EHsc lib\MD5.cpp -Fo:lib\
and then i compile my main file and link it with the previously compiled obj file
cl /EHsc -Z7 d5.cpp lib\MD5.obj -Fo:build\ -Fe:build\

or i can just include all cpp files into one file that i compile -> unity build (which casey uses)
